**Welcome to the official Icicle guide!**\
****Whether you came here to learn Icicle from scratch, or you just want to understand a specific module, we hope this guide will be useful for you.\


Before you go further, we ask you, to **rate the pages** of these guides, **so we can get a clear idea of what is unclear**, and what needs work. You can do it at the bottom of the pages via these 3 simple buttons:

Lastly, we wanna thank GitBook for providing us with an OpenSource License and making this documentation possible.

With that out of the way, you can continue to: [Getting Started](get-started.md).

## FAQ

Hesitant to use Icicle, or you simply have questions regarding it? Before asking us on Discord, please, be sure to read through this, as we get these questions a lot.

### Is Icicle easy to learn?

If you're coming from a Spring background, or you have used dependency injection (beans) before, then **you will pick up Icicle very easily**.

If all of these sound foreign, then don't feel disqualified. After you've [learned the basics](broken-reference), you will adjust to Icicle no-time.

### Is Icicle free?

**Yes**, our goal is to help every plugin developer in the world, and let's face it: everyone hates paywalls.

### Will it affect my server's performance?

**No, but it may prolong server loading.**

Even though Icicle is a complex system, all the time-consuming parts (scanning, registering) are done at startup - when all the other plugins & worlds load.&#x20;

### Do sever owners need to install Icicle?

**Yes**, every server owner who utilizes Icicle-based plugins needs to install Icicle in the server's plugin directory.

This is so, that all the magic is contained in one place, and will not be unnecessarily duplicated (therefore saving precious memory and storage)

### Can I donate?

We **currently** do **no**t have any ways to accept donations, but we're planning to set up a Ko-Fi or Patreon page.

### Can I contribute?

**Of course**, you can! Open-source projects are all about the community. This generosity of others is what enables Icicle to stay up-to-date with all the developer needs. \
