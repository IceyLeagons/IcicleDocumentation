# üåê Localization

Providing multi-language support is vital for a successful plugin. Icicle provides an easy-to-use system with a built-in script language similar to Excel's.

Localization is done through the `TranslationService`.

### Setting up StringProviders

`StringProviders` are the ones that provide the `TranslationService` with a string for a key from a file. With this abstraction, the developers can implement any kind of source they can think of, be it a simple file-based one, or maybe a remote solution.&#x20;

### Setting up LanguageProviders

`LanguageProviders` are the ones responsible for providing a language code for a `Player`. Sources can be databases, geolocation, or just a fallback fixed language.

### Using the TranslationService

The `TranslationService` must be auto-wired. By default - if no providers have been set up - it will use "en" as the language, and will only use the default values.

When first getting keys, the service will automatically append the default values to a translation file of choice (`StringProvider` must be set up for this).

{% hint style="warning" %}
By default the **TranslationService does not parse color codes**, as it's in the core module, and the core does not depend on Bukkit.
{% endhint %}

### Advanced Usage - String Code

`StringCode` is a special Excel formula-like script language, that provides translators with the ability to write logic inside a string, therefore making language-specific tasks easier.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Code must be written between {}, escaping with \ is supported.

<summary>Example</summary>

```java
You have {IF(EQ(amount, 1), IF(SW(item, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'),'an','a'),amount)} {item}{IF(GT(amount, 1), 's', '')}.
```

`amount` and `item` are parameters passed from the plugin.

If the amount is 12, and the item is apple: `You have 12 apples.`\
If the amount is 1, and the item is apple: `You have an apple.`\
If the amount is 1, and the item is pear: `You have a pear.`

The following table shows all the functions you can use & their purpose.

{% hint style="info" %}
These are just the built-in functions. The system is completely expandable.

| Function                                   | Description                                                                                                    |

| **IF**(statement, true, false)             | If the statement is true, then the value inside true will be returned, otherwise the value inside false.       |
| **OR**(statement1, \[statement2], ...)     | If any of the statements inside the function return true, then the function will return true, otherwise false. |
| **NOT**(statement)                         | Returns the logical opposite of the statement.                                                                 |
| **AND**(statement1, \[statement2], ...)    | This function will only return true, if all of the statements inside it return true.                           |
| **EW**(value, test, \[test2], ...)         | Tests whether the value ends with the supplied test values. Will return true/false accordingly.                |
| **SW**(value, test, \[test2], ...)         | Tests whether the value starts with the supplied test values. Will return true/false accordingly.              |
| **NE**(value1, value2)                     | This function will return true if value1 and value2 do not match.                                              |
| **EQ**(value1, value2)                     | This function will return true if value1 is equal to value2.                                                   |
| **LTEQ**(number1, number2)                 | Tests whether number1 is equal to or less than the second number2.                                             |

| **CONCAT**(value, \[value2], ...)          | Concatonates the values inside the function, and returns them.                                                 |
